# OpenA3XX Hardware Controller

## Aim
OPENA3XX is an ambitious project for all Airbus flight simmers. 
The aim of the project is to build a home affordable Airbus cockpit made of open source tools, hardware, and software. 
Real Airbus pilots is also consulting to the look & feel, behaviour and functionality! 
At this point, our goal is to have a DIY cockpit integrated fully with the A320 Flybywire mod in 
Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.
