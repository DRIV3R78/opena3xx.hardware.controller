# Install & Uninstall

### Please do **NOT** use the "ip-test.ch" script
This is because it will affect your configuration file. It is still in development, and does not do anything that is needed yet.

## Please refer to the main 'How To Install' document for full instructions

You should only ever need to use `"setup.sh"` and `"uninstall.sh"`.

Don't forget you will need to set permissions to run the scripts.
For example:  
```
cd /home/pi/opena3xx.hardware.controller/setup
sudo chmod +x setup.sh
sudo ./setup.sh
```

Once you have run setup, follow the rest of the instructions.

<i>For **Uninstall**, it's the same code above but replace **setup.sh** with **uninstall.sh**</i>
